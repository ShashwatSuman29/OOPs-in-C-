# 💻 C++ Concepts – Basics with Examples

## 📌 USER-DEFINED DATA TYPES

Suppose you want to store the **name** (`string`), **roll number** (`int`), and **CGPA** (`float`) of **50 students**.  
You **can’t store all of this mixed data in a single array** because:

- Arrays store **only one type** of data (like all `int` or all `string`).
- You need to store **different types of data together** for each student.

👉 **To store all this related information together**, you create your **own custom data type** – this is called a **user-defined data type**.

---

## 🔄 PASSING OBJECTS TO FUNCTION

You can create a **function that automatically prints the details** of a class object when it's called.  
This helps to:
- **Save time**
- **Reduce complexity** of the code/program

---

## 📥 PASS BY VALUE

- A **copy** of the original variable or object is passed to the function.
- Any changes made **inside the function do NOT affect** the original variable.

---

## 🔗 PASS BY REFERENCE

- The **actual variable** is passed to the function using a reference (`&`).
- Any change made inside the function **directly affects** the original variable.

---

## 🏗️ What is a Constructor in C++?

A **constructor** is a special function inside a class that **automatically runs when you create an object** of that class.

It is used to:
- **Give initial values** to the object’s data members.
- **Set things up** when the object is created.

### ✅ Basic Rules of Constructors:
- A constructor has the **same name as the class**.
- It **does not have any return type** (not even `void`).
- It **runs automatically** when an object is made.

---

# 🚀 Types of Constructors in C++

In C++, **constructors** are special functions that are **automatically called** when an object of a class is created. They are mainly used to **initialize object properties**.

---

## 🔹 1. Default Constructor

A **default constructor** takes **no arguments**. It sets **default values** to the object's data members.

### ✅ Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll;

    // Default Constructor
    Student() {
        name = "Unknown";
        roll = 0;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;
    s1.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:
```
Name: Unknown, Roll: 0
```

---

## 🔹 2. Parameterized Constructor

A **parameterized constructor** takes arguments so you can assign **custom values** to the object at the time of creation.

### ✅ Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(string n, int r) {
        name = n;
        roll = r;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1("Shashwat", 101);
    s1.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:
```
Name: Shashwat, Roll: 101
```

---

## 🔹 3. Copy Constructor

A **copy constructor** creates a **new object** by **copying values** from an existing object of the same class.

### ✅ Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll;

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Student(string n, int r) {
        name = n;
        roll = r;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Student(const Student &s) {
        name = s.name;
        roll = s.roll;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1("Shashwat", 101);
    Student s2 = s1; // Copy constructor is called
    s2.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:
```
Name: Shashwat, Roll: 101
```

| Constructor Type         | Arguments      | Purpose                                     |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Default Constructor      | ❌ No          | Sets default values                         |
| Parameterized Constructor| ✅ Yes         | Sets custom values during object creation   |
| Copy Constructor         | ✅ Yes (object)| Creates a new object by copying another     |

> 💡 Constructors make object creation easier and more flexible by initializing data automatically.


# 🔑 `this` Keyword in C++ (Constructor Context)

In C++, the `this` keyword is a **special pointer** available inside all **non-static member functions**, including **constructors**.  
It points to the **current object** that is being created or used.

---

## 📌 In the Context of Constructors:

When a constructor initializes an object’s data members, the `this` pointer helps **distinguish between local variables and class members** if they have the **same name**.

---

## 🧠 Why Use `this`?

- When the **parameter name is the same** as the **data member name**, `this->` makes it clear that you're referring to the **data member**.
- It **improves code clarity** and **prevents confusion**.

---

> 🔍 `this` is especially useful in constructors to write clean, readable, and unambiguous code.

# 📌 Object Pointer in C++

In C++, an **object pointer** is a pointer that is used to **store the address of an object**.  
Just like you can create a pointer to an `int`, `float`, or other data type, you can also create a pointer to a **class object**.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Object Pointers?

- To **access members** of an object dynamically.
- To **pass large objects efficiently**.
- To work with **arrays of objects**, **dynamic memory**, and **polymorphism** (advanced use).

---

## ✅ Syntax:
```cpp
ClassName *ptr;
```

---

## ✅ Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int roll;

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;
    s1.name = "Shashwat";
    s1.roll = 101;

    // Object pointer
    Student *ptr = &s1;

    // Accessing members using pointer
    ptr->display();  // Same as s1.display()

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🔹 Important Operators:

| Operator | Use                                      |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `->`     | To access members using object pointer   |
| `*`      | To dereference the pointer               |

---

## 📌 Summary

- Object pointers store the **address of class objects**.
- Use `->` to access class members through the pointer.
- Useful for dynamic memory allocation, passing by reference, and OOP concepts like polymorphism.

---

> 🚀 Object pointers give you more control and flexibility in object-oriented programming in C++.

# 💡 Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++

**Dynamic memory allocation** means allocating memory **at runtime** (while the program is running), instead of at compile time.

In C++, we use the `new` and `delete` operators to manage dynamic memory.

---

## 📌 Why Use Dynamic Allocation?

- When you **don’t know the size** of data in advance.
- To **create objects or arrays at runtime**.
- To **efficiently manage memory usage**.

---

## ✅ Syntax

### 🔸 Allocate memory:
```cpp
int *ptr = new int;        // Single int
int *arr = new int[5];     // Array of 5 integers
```

### 🔸 Free memory:
```cpp
delete ptr;       // Free single variable
delete[] arr;     // Free array
```

---

## ✅ Example: Dynamic Allocation for Single Variable
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int *p = new int;   // allocate memory
    *p = 10;            // assign value
    cout << *p << endl;

    delete p;           // free memory
    return 0;
}
```

---

## ✅ Example: Dynamic Allocation for Object
```cpp
class Student {
public:
    int roll;
    void display() {
        cout << "Roll: " << roll << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student *s = new Student;
    s->roll = 101;
    s->display();

    delete s;  // free memory
    return 0;
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Points

- Always use `delete` or `delete[]` to **free memory** created with `new`.
- Not freeing memory can cause **memory leaks**.
- `new` returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

---

> 🧠 Dynamic memory allocation gives your programs flexibility and efficient memory usage — especially useful in larger applications.

# 📚 Vector in C++

In C++, a **vector** is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL).  
It is a **dynamic array** that can **grow or shrink in size automatically** as elements are added or removed. 
When the size and capacity of the vector is same , then it will create a new array/vector of double size.

---

## ✅ Why Use Vectors?

- You don't need to know the size in advance.
- Automatically manages memory.
- Comes with useful built-in functions (like `.push_back()`, `.size()`, `.pop_back()`, etc.).

# 🔐 Access Modifiers in C++

In C++, **access modifiers** are used to set the level of access (or visibility) for **class members** (variables and functions).

They help protect the internal data of a class and define how that data can be accessed from outside the class.

---

## ✅ Types of Access Modifiers:

### 1. `public`

- Members declared as `public` **can be accessed from anywhere** (inside or outside the class).
- No restriction on access.

```cpp
class Student {
public:
    int roll;
    void display() {
        cout << "Roll: " << roll;
    }
};

```
### 2. `private`
Members declared as private can only be accessed within the class.

Cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

```cpp
Copy code
class Student {
private:
    int roll;

public:
    void setRoll(int r) {
        roll = r;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Roll: " << roll;
    }
};

```
### 3. `protected`
Works like private, but it can also be accessed by derived (child) classes.

Not accessible from outside the class directly.

```cpp
Copy code
class Base {
protected:
    int value;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        value = 100; // allowed because it's protected
        cout << value;
    }
};

```

| Access Modifier | Access in Class | Access Outside Class | Access in Derived Class |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `public`        | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes                   |
| `private`       | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                 | ❌ No                    |
| `protected`     | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                   |


# 🎯 Getter and Setter in C++

In C++, **getters** and **setters** are special functions used to **access** and **update** private data members of a class.

They help in achieving **encapsulation** by keeping the data safe and providing controlled access.

---

## ✅ Why Use Getter and Setter?

- To protect the internal data of the class.
- To control how data is read or modified.
- To apply validation before setting a value.

---

## 🔹 Getter (Access Function)

- Used to **read/access** the value of a private data member.
- Usually starts with the word `get`.

## 🔹 Setter (Mutator Function)
- Used to set/update the value of a private data member.

## 🧬 What is Inheritance in C++?

**Inheritance** is one of the core features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called the **derived** or **child class**) to inherit properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class (called the **base** or **parent class**).

This helps in **code reusability** and creates a logical hierarchy between classes.

---
# 🔄 Types of Inheritance in C++

Inheritance is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming in C++. It allows a new class (called the derived class) to reuse the properties and behavior (data members and functions) of an existing class (called the base class). This helps reduce code duplication and supports code reusability.

---

## 1️⃣ Single Inheritance

In Single Inheritance, a class inherits from only one base class.

**Example Use Case**: A `Dog` class inherits basic behavior from an `Animal` class.

---

## 2️⃣ Multilevel Inheritance

In Multilevel Inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class. This forms a chain of inheritance.

**Example Use Case**: A `Puppy` class inherits from `Dog`, and `Dog` inherits from `Animal`.

---

## 3️⃣ Multiple Inheritance

In Multiple Inheritance, a single derived class inherits from more than one base class.

**Example Use Case**: A class `C` inherits features from both class `A` and class `B`.

🧠 **Note**: It can lead to ambiguity if both base classes have the same function. This is resolved using the scope resolution operator.

---

## 4️⃣ Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, combining multiple and multilevel inheritance.

**Example Use Case**: A class might inherit from two classes that themselves inherit from the same base class, leading to a "diamond problem."  
🔧 **Solution**: This can be handled using **virtual inheritance** in C++ to avoid ambiguity.

---

Each type of inheritance helps model different real-world relationships and promotes cleaner, reusable, and organized code.



# Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming

**Polymorphism** means "many forms". In OOP, it refers to the ability of a function, object, or operator to behave differently based on context.

## Types of Polymorphism

### 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding)
- Achieved during compile time.
- Common forms:
  - **Function Overloading**
  - **Operator Overloading**
  - **Constructor Overloading**

**Example: Function Overloading**
```cpp
class Print {
public:
    void show(int i) { std::cout << "Integer: " << i << std::endl; }
    void show(double d) { std::cout << "Double: " << d << std::endl; }
};
```

**Example: Constructor Overloading**
```cpp
class Point {
public:
    Point() {}
    Point(int x, int y) {}
};
```

**Example: Operator Overloading**
```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
        Complex res;
        res.real = real + obj.real;
        res.imag = imag + obj.imag;
        return res;
    }
};
```

### 2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)
- Achieved during runtime using **inheritance** and **virtual functions**.
- Enables method overriding.

**Example: Runtime Polymorphism**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { std::cout << "Base class" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { std::cout << "Derived class" << std::endl; }
};

Base* obj = new Derived();
obj->show();  // Output: Derived class
```

## Summary Table

| Type                  | Binding Time | Mechanism                        | Example                           |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Compile-Time          | Compile Time | Function/Constructor/Operator Overloading | `show(int)` and `show(double)`    |
| Run-Time              | Run Time     | Inheritance + Virtual Functions  | `Base* b = new Derived(); b->show();` |



# Static Members and Static Functions in C++

## Static Member Variables

A **static member variable** is shared among all objects of a class. It is not tied to any one object, and there is only one copy of it in memory regardless of how many objects are created.

### Characteristics:
- Declared using the `static` keyword inside the class.
- Shared by all instances of the class.
- Useful for tracking common properties like object count, global settings, etc.
---

## Static Member Functions

A **static member function** can be called using the class name without creating an object. It can only access **static members** (both variables and functions).

### Characteristics:
- Declared using the `static` keyword.
- Cannot access non-static members or `this` pointer.
- Often used to manipulate or access static data members.

---

## Summary

| Feature             | Static Member Variable       | Static Member Function             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Shared across objects | ✅ Yes                     | N/A                                |
| Accesses static members | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                              |
| Accesses non-static members | ❌ No              | ❌ No                               |
| Called using object | ✅ Optional                  | ✅ Optional                         |
| Called using class name | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                              |



# Encapsulation in C++

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

## Key Points:
- Achieved using **classes** in C++.
- **Private** and **protected** access modifiers are used to hide data.
- Provides **data hiding** and **controlled access** via public methods (getters/setters).
- Enhances **security**, **modularity**, and **maintainability** of code.

## Benefits:
- Prevents unauthorized access to internal data.
- Maintains integrity by validating inputs through methods.
- Makes code more modular and easier to debug or maintain.

## Summary

| Feature             | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Purpose             | Data protection and controlled access      |
| Implemented via     | Classes and access specifiers              |
| Common Tools        | `private`, `public`, `protected`, getters/setters |



# Abstraction in C++

**Abstraction** in C++ is an object-oriented programming principle that focuses on exposing only relevant functionalities while hiding internal implementation details.

## Key Points:

- **Abstraction** reduces complexity by hiding unneeded internal mechanics from the user.
- It emphasizes **what** an object does rather than **how** it does it.
- In C++, abstraction is mainly implemented using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

---

## Abstract Class in C++

An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains at least one **pure virtual function**. It serves as a blueprint for other classes.

### Characteristics:
- Acts as a base class for other derived classes.
- Enforces a contract for derived classes to implement specific behavior.
- Useful when you want to provide a common interface for different implementations.

---

## Summary

| Concept         | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstraction     | Hiding internal details and exposing only essential features |
| Abstract Class  | A class with at least one pure virtual function              |
| Purpose         | Define interfaces and enforce method implementation          |
| Instantiation   | Cannot instantiate directly                                  |


# Pure Virtual Function in C++

A **pure virtual function** in C++ is a virtual function that is declared within a base class and is meant to be **overridden** in derived classes.

## Key Characteristics:

- Has no implementation in the base class.
- Forces derived classes to provide an implementation.
- Makes the class an **abstract class**.

## Abstract Class:

When a class contains **at least one pure virtual function**, it becomes an **abstract class** and **cannot be instantiated**.

## Summary:

| Feature                | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pure Virtual Function  | A virtual function with no definition, declared as `= 0`      |
| Abstract Class         | A class with at least one pure virtual function               |
| Instantiable           | ❌ No (cannot create objects directly)                         |
| Purpose                | To define an interface and enforce implementation in children |
