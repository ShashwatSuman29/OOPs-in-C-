USER DEFINED DATAYPES:-

Suppose you want to store the name (string), roll number (int), and CGPA (float) of 50 students.
You can’t store all of this mixed data in a single array because:

-Arrays store only one type of data (like all int or all string).
-You need to store different types of data together for each student.

"To store all this related information together, you create your own custom data type – this is called a user-defined data type."


PASSING OBJECTS TO FUNCTION:-
A function that automatically prints the details of a class when it's called.
so it saves times and reduces the complexity of the code/program.
